**HaruTwo Inventory** is an online inventory system for  **HaruTwo Shop**, a small online import business located in Chile.

This online inventory system is planned to be used remotely by the  store owners due location limitations in order to keep a better record of the store's inventory.



It counts with a Login and Register system that, due demo purposes, are located on the navigation bar. It is thought that, since it is a private inventory, it only allows remote access to the  inventory administrators which, also, are the only ones in charge to register new users if required. 

Currently, HaruTwo Inventory allows to login users, register users , display inventory elements, edit and delete inventory items as well as display a preview for the latter actions.

It is  planned change the login system and the inventory view design. Also, to add a way to scrap tracking information and a client's database, as well as a change log system and a search bar in the near future.
